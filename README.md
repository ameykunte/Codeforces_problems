# Codeforces Problems

This repository contains solutions to [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) problems that I have solved. The solutions are written in C++, and I have organized them in order of popularity, starting with the most popularly solved ones and working my way up.

## Motivation

The main motivation behind this repository is to keep a record of the problems I have solved on Codeforces and to track my progress as I work on improving my programming skills. I have also made this repository public to allow others to learn from my solutions and to contribute their own solutions or improvements.

## Usage

The solutions in this repository are organized into folders based on the problem's difficulty level and its contest number. Each folder contains a solution file in C++, and a README file that describes the problem and its solution.

To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/ameykunte/Codeforces_problems.git
```

Then navigate to the folder containing the problem you wish to solve and open the solution file in your preferred text editor.

## Compiling and Running the Code

To compile the C++ code in this repository, you will need a C++ compiler installed on your system. If you're using a Linux or Mac system, you can use the g++ compiler, which can be installed using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install g++
```

If you're using a Windows system, you can use the MinGW compiler, which can be downloaded from the [MinGW website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).

Once you have a C++ compiler installed, you can compile the code using the following command:

```
g++ -o <output-file-name> <source-file-name>.cpp
```

For example, to compile the solution for problem A in contest 1, you can use the following command:

```
g++ -o a1 A1.cpp
```

This will generate an executable file with the name `a1` in the same directory.

To run the executable file, simply type the name of the file followed by any input parameters that the program requires. For example, to run the executable file for problem A in contest 1, you can use the following command:

```
./a1
```

This will execute the program and display the output on the screen.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to this repository in the form of new solutions, improvements to existing solutions, or additional problem descriptions. If you wish to contribute, please create a pull request and I will review it as soon as possible.

When contributing, please make sure to follow these guidelines:

- Include a detailed description of the problem and your solution in the README file.
- Write clean and well-documented code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Follow good coding practices and conventions.



## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Codeforces for providing a platform for programmers to improve their skills and for hosting a vast collection of programming problems. I would also like to thank the open-source community for their contributions to the development of programming tools and libraries that have made this project possible.
